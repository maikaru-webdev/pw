        <p><em>Web Developer in Training!</em></p>
        <p>Graduated from <a href="https://wayne.edu/">Wayne State University!</a><br>
          I am a 27 year old African American male who loves to play video games, I love to drink tea and coffee, I love to draw, and I also was dianogsed with ADHD.</p>
          <p>
            I <strong>really</strong> want to become a Web Developer, because I think it is very fun to design the very websites we use for our everyday needs. [That can be for entertainment, searching recipies, and so much more!] <br>
          Maybe one day I can create my own websites for people to take a look at or even land a job as a full-stack developer for a big company in the future.</td>
